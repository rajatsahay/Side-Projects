"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis" : Dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward and/or convolutional networks contain subnetworks ("winning tickets") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective.
