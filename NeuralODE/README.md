The main contributions of the paper:
+Introduces a continuous-depth DNN architecture, Neural ODE (NODE), inspired by ResNet and can replace ResNet
+How to efficiently train NODE with continuous backpropagation using ordinary differential equations (ODE)
+Interesting applications in time-series and generative models.
